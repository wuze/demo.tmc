It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:\n\n1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).\n\n2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.\n\nThe buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble\n",
